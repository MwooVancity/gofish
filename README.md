GO FISH -PYTHON GAME


 Astandard 52 card deck is used. The dealer deals 10 cards to each player. 
 The remaining cards are placed face down to form a stock. 
 The player to dealer's left starts. A turn consists of asking a target player for a target rank .
 For example, if it is my turn I might say: 'Mary, please give me your jacks'. 
 Thus “Mary” being target player and “jacks” being target rank .
The player who asks (referred to as hitman ) must already hold at least one card of the target rank , 
so I must hold at least one jack to ask Mary for jacks. If the target player (Mary) has cards of the target rank 
(jacks in this case), she must give all her cards of this rank to the hitman , we will denote this as a hit for the hitman .
Then hitman gets another turn and may again target any player for any rank already held by the hitman .
If the target player does not have any cards of target rank , they say 'Go fish!' to the hitman .
The hitman must then draw the top card of the undealt stock. If the drawn card is the same as the target rank ,
the hitman shows it and gets another turn, we will denote this as a hit for the hitman too, albeit a lucky one! 
If the drawn card is not of target rank , the hitman keeps it (we will denote this as a miss for the hitman ), 
but the turn now passes to the player who said 'Go fish!' . As soon as a player collects a book of 4 cards of the same
rank, this must be shown and discarded face down. The game continues until either someone has no cards left in their 
hand or the stock runs out. The winner is the player who then has the most books.
